Hi! My name is Renan Carvalho. I'm Brazilian, 29 years old, and a Data Science enthusiast. Right ahead I give you a briefing.


### My History

So I started my *graduation* in [Biosystems Engineering](http://www.fzea.usp.br/en/?page_id=1930) in the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) back in 2012, where as in all engineerings syllabus I took courses over *linear algebra*, *calculus*, followed by *statistics*, the fundamentals to *understand a Data Science models*, added to operational research and numerical methods for optimization. Also, I had an introduction over digital systems, signal processing, image analysis, and AI, which there already called my attention due to its complexity, but also applicability, each day more present in our lives. 

During this period, I made an *internship* in Germany and Spain (check out my [LinkdIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renan-souza-carvalho/) for more specifics), and was also a member in the Electrical Efficiency and Numerical Simulation Laboratory, working with thermodynamics and numerical simulations, which triggered my *[Masters in Energy Technology (Solar)](http://ieepos.webhostusp.sti.usp.br/?q=en/ieeusp-laboratories)* also in USP, where I made a model and carried a numerical simulation of solar cavity receiver (if you want, check it out my *Master's [Dissertation](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/106/106134/tde-30062020-150746/en.php)*).

Through my Masters journey, I had my first contact with **Python** (before that, I'd always used MATLAB and Mathematica), and how one cannot fall for that? An open source programming language with so many resources? FSo for the last couple months, I've been studying **Data Science** (which is **awesome!**) in **Python** (also **awesome!**), and got really into it. And that's why I made this portfolio website, and this is why you should check out my [Git](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho?tab=repositories)!
