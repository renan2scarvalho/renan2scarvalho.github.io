Hi! My name is Renan Carvalho. I'm Brazilian, 29 years old, and a Data Science enthusiast. Right ahead I give you a briefing.

What else do you need?

### My History

I'm graduated in [Biosystems Engineering](http://www.fzea.usp.br/en/?page_id=1930), and have a Masters in [Energy Technology (Solar)](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/106/106134/tde-30062020-150746/en.php). 
For the last couple months, I've been studying Data Science (which is **awesoome!**), and got really into it. So this is why I made this portfolio website, and this is why you should check out my [Git](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho?tab=repositories)!
